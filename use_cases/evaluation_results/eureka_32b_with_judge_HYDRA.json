This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, including the return address of the function, which can be altered to point to malicious code.\n\n2. **Heap Buffer Overflow**: Similar to stack buffer overflows, but this type of overflow targets buffers allocated on the heap. Exploiting heap overflows can be more complex, as they often require precise control over memory allocation and deallocation.\n\n3. **Format String Attack**: This is a type of buffer overflow where the attacker uses a format string vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. By controlling the format string argument of a function like `printf`, the attacker can manipulate the stack and overwrite function return addresses.\n\n4. **Return-to-libc Attack**: In this"
